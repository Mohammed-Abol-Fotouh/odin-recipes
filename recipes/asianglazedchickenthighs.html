    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Asian chicken thighs are slightly spicy but the sweetness tames the heat. Delicious served with rice. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup rice vinegar </li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce (such as Silver Swan®) </li>
        <li>5 tablespoons honey </li>
        <li>¼ cup Asian (toasted) sesame oil </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Asian chili garlic sauce </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic </li>
        <li>salt to taste </li>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, honey, toasted sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, minced garlic, and salt together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag; retain the other 1/2 of the marinade for the sauce. Place chicken thighs into the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour, turning the bag once or twice.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Meanwhile, pour reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and simmer, stirring often, until thick, 3 to 5 minutes; set sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken thighs from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard used marinade. Place chicken thighs into a 9x13-inch baking dish; brush with 1/3 of the thickened marinade from the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, basting one more time after 10 minutes; an instant-read thermometer inserted into a chicken thigh should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Let stand for 5 or 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring sauce back to a boil for 1 minute; serve over chicken and sprinkle with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
